## Builder Design Pattern:

The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction 
of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process 
to create different representations. 
It is useful when you have a complex object with many optional parameters or configurations.

This code demonstrates how the Builder design pattern can be used to create Computer objects 
with flexible configuration options, allowing for easy construction of complex objects with 
various specifications.
