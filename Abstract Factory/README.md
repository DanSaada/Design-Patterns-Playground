# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Definition:
The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
It falls under the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns and is commonly used in software development to promote flexibility and maintainability by ensuring that the system's components are loosely coupled to the specific classes they use.

## Advantages:
* Abstraction and Encapsulation: It encapsulates the object creation process and provides an abstract interface, promoting a high level of abstraction in the code.
* Flexibility: The pattern allows you to switch between different families of objects by changing the concrete factory without altering the client code. This flexibility is especially useful when you need to support multiple platforms or configurations.
* Maintainability: It makes it easier to add new types of products or families of objects because you can create new concrete factories and products without modifying existing code.

## Disadvantages:
* Complexity: Implementing the Abstract Factory pattern can lead to a more complex codebase, especially when dealing with a large number of product types and families. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
* Increased Code Volume: Introducing abstract factories, concrete factories, and product hierarchies can increase the volume of code in the project.
* Tight Coupling: In some cases, the client code may become tightly coupled to the concrete factory classes, making it harder to change the factory without impacting the client code.


## Code Example:
In this example, the UIFactory interface defines methods for creating UI components. 
Concrete factories like WindowsUIFactory and MacOSUIFactory provide implementations for creating UI components specific to each platform. 
Clients can use these factories to create UI components without knowing the underlying platform details, promoting flexibility and platform independence.
